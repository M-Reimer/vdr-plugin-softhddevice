missing:
    software deinterlace (yadif, ...)
    software decoder with software deinterlace
    zoom/fit-zoom 4:3 (SetVideoDisplayFormat, SetVideoFormat?)
    ITU BT601, ITU BT709 (HD), RGB studio levels (16-235)?
    suspend output / energie saver: stop audio, stop video, configurable
    Option deinterlace off / deinterlace force!
    Make output drivers better modular (under construction).

video:
    subtitle not cleared
    subtitle could be asyncron
    reduce warnings after channel switch
    grab image with hardware and better scaling support
    suspendoutput didn't show logo or black pictures
	(must detect video format to show image)

vdpau:
    VdpPreemptionCallback handling (under construction)
    hard channel switch

libva:
    hard channel switch
    yaepghd (VaapiSetOutputPosition) support
    can associate ony displayed part of osd
    ready(not intel checked) auto crop for va-api
    grab image for va-api
    still many:
    [drm:i915_hangcheck_elapsed] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... GPU hung
    [drm:i915_wait_request] *ERROR* i915_wait_request returns -11 ...

libva: branch vaapi-ext
    add support for vaapi-ext

libva-intel-driver:
    intel still has hangups most with 1080i
    1080i does no v-sync (workaround written, fixed with vaapi-ext)
    OSD has sometimes wrong size (workaround written)

libva-vdpau-driver:
    G210/GT520 OSD update too slow (needs hardware problem workaround)
    hangup on exit (VaapiDelDecoder -> VaapiCleanup
	-> vaDestroyContext -> pthread_rwlock_wrlock)
    with auto-crop OSD has wrong position

libva-xvba-driver:
    with auto-crop OSD has wrong position

x11:
    disable screensaver

audio:
    write TS -> PES parser, which feeds audio before the next start packet
    CodecAudioOpen can fail "can't open audio codec" and does Fatal exit.
    Combine alsa+oss ringbuffer code.
    Make alsa thread/polled and oss thread/polled output module runtime
    selectable.

audio/alsa:
    better downmix of >2 channels on 2 channel hardware
    remix support of unsupported sample rates
    libav supports only resample of mono to 2 channels
    ffmpeg didn't support resample of 5 to 2 channels

audio/oss:
    alsa oss emulation mixer "pcm" not working
    ring buffer overflow with alsa oss emulation

HDMI/SPDIF Passthrough:
    only AC-3 written
    Channels are wrong setup, if changing setting during operation.
    split pcm and ac-3 out into two devices
    support oss pass-through

playback of recording
    pause is not reset, when replay exit
    replay/pause need 100% cpu

setup:
    Setup of decoder type.
    Setup of output type.
    Setup of display type.
    Setup 4:3 zoom type
    Some setup parameters are not used until restart.
	Can a notice be added to the setup menu?

unsorted:
    Menu -> Setup -> Plugins -> skingenigmang -> General
	-> Try 8bpp single area: no, has missing parts.

future features (not planed for 1.0 - 1.5)

    video out with xv
    video out with opengl
    video out with xvba
    software decoder for xv / opengl
    atmolight support
    multistream handling
    pip support
    grab image with jpeg

    upmix stereo to AC-3
