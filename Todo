missing:
    software deinterlace (yadif, ...)
    software decoder with software deinterlace
    ITU BT601, ITU BT709 (HD), RGB studio levels (16-235)?
    suspend output / energie saver: stop and restart X11
    suspend plugin didn't restore full-screen (is this wanted?)
    Option deinterlace off / deinterlace force!

crash:
    AudioPlayHandlerThread -> pthread_cond_wait

video:
    subtitle not cleared
    subtitle could be asyncron
    reduce warnings after channel switch
    grab image with hardware and better scaling support
    suspendoutput didn't show logo or black pictures
	(must detect video format to show image)
    hard channel switch
    OSD can only be shown after some stream could be shown
    yaepghd changed position is lost on channel switch
    use x11 screen size without geometry configuration

vdpau:
    software decoder path not working

libva:
    yaepghd (VaapiSetOutputPosition) support
    can associate only displayed part of osd
    grab image for va-api
    remove stderr output of libva init
    still many: (workaround export NO_MPEG_HW=1)
    [drm:i915_hangcheck_elapsed] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... GPU hung
    [drm:i915_wait_request] *ERROR* i915_wait_request returns -11 ...

libva: branch vaapi-ext
    add support for vaapi-ext

libva-intel-driver:
    deinterlace only supported with vaapi-ext
    1080i does no v-sync (sometimes correct working with vaapi-ext)
    OSD has sometimes wrong size (workaround written)
    sometimes software decoder deinterlace isn't working and 1080i channels
    show artefacts

libva-vdpau-driver:
    G210/GT520 OSD update too slow (needs hardware problem workaround)
    hangup on exit (VaapiDelDecoder -> VaapiCleanup
	-> vaDestroyContext -> pthread_rwlock_wrlock)
    OSD still has some problems with auto-crop and 4:3 zoom.

libva-xvba-driver:

x11:
    disable screensaver
    skip multiple configure-notify, handle only the last one.
    support embedded mode

audio:
    write TS -> PES parser, which feeds audio before the next start packet
    Combine alsa+oss ringbuffer code.
    Make alsa thread/polled and oss thread/polled output module runtime
    selectable.
    software volume support
    add pause support for replay pause
    some plugin send a private LPCM stream (CODEC_ID_PCM_DVD), which
    isn't supported by ffmpeg, write own parser.

audio/alsa:
    better downmix of >2 channels on 2 channel hardware
    remix support of unsupported sample rates
    libav supports only resample of mono to 2 channels
    ffmpeg didn't support resample of 5 to 2 channels

audio/oss:
    alsa oss emulation mixer "pcm" not working
    oss4 mixer channel not working
    ring buffer overflow with alsa oss emulation

HDMI/SPDIF Passthrough:
    only AC-3 written
    Channels are wrong setup, if changing setting during operation.
    support oss pass-through

playback of recording
    pause is not reset, when replay exit
    replay/pause need 100% cpu

setup:
    Setup of decoder type.
    Setup of output type.
    Setup of display type.
    Setup 4:3 zoom type
    Some setup parameters are not used until restart.
	Can a notice be added to the setup menu?

unsorted:
    stoping vdr while plugin is suspended opens and closes a window.

future features (not planed for 1.0 - 1.5)

    video out with xv
    video out with opengl
    video out with xvba
    software decoder for xv / opengl
    atmolight support
    multistream handling
    pip support
    save and use auto-crop with channel zapping

    upmix stereo to AC-3
